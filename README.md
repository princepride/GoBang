## Game Introduction

This is my first side project after I started learning programming. This is a java graphics program.

I also wrote an AI that used recursive search for all solutions and returned the highest rated solution as the return value.

Since then I've been thinking, **what if solving one problem could unlock solutions to thousands more?**
